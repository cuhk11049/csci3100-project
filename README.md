## Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- Ruby `3.3.8`
- Bundler
- PostgreSQL
- Redis


### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RangerBZ/csci3100-project.git
cd csci3100-project
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill in the required values.

Example:

```env
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

Notes:

- `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` are required for PostgreSQL.
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is needed for the password reset email feature.
- `MAPBOX_TOKEN` is needed for the location map pages.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is used by the seeded admin account in development/test.

### 5. Prepare the Database

```bash
bin/rails db:prepare
bin/rails db:seed
```

The seeded data includes:

- sample users
- sample item listings
- CUHK-related locations
- a development/test admin account

### 6. Start Required Services

Start Redis in a separate terminal:

```bash
redis-server
```

Start Sidekiq in another terminal if you want background jobs and scheduled jobs:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### 7. Run the Application

```bash
bin/dev
```

If `bin/dev` is unavailable in your environment, you can also run:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Test Guide

### Run the automated tests

Run Rails tests:

```bash
bin/rails rspec
```

Run Cucumber features:

```bash
bundle exec cucumber
```

## Demo / Deployment

- Demo URL: <https://csci3100-proj.onrender.com/>
- Demo video: `handed later in BlackBoard`

## Side notes
- The SendGrid API offcial sending requires a formal domain name, this project only uses single sender API, so it comes from personal .gmail address. Possibly needs to look up in trash mail folder. Email send might take up to 5 minutes. (The sendGrid may throw 404 in our tests for continous sends / invalid address / exceeds respond ratio)
- Access to the Sidekiq dashboard (for background job monitoring) is strictly restricted to Admin users only. Regular users are denied access to ensure system security and prevent unauthorized operation monitoring.
- Users can choose to purchase or reserve items. Once they have reserved an item, it could not be purchased or reserved by any other users.
- Only the user who posted the item can delete it.
- Some Hidden rules for users from different college (SaaS Angle):
  (1) Users from Chung Chi College will see items from Chung Chi College and S.H.HO College listed with priority
  (2) Users from United College will see items from United College and New Asia College listed with priority
  (3) Only users from Shaw College can reserve items from their college
  The priority effect will disappear after filter sorting is set.
- The admin user is created, only admin can view the button for redis server in our setting. (linked with admin_password in .env for seeds).
