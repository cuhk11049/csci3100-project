# Campus Trade

## Project Overview

Campus Trade is a Ruby on Rails marketplace web application for the CUHK community. It allows users to register with a `@link.cuhk.edu.hk` email address, sign in, publish items, browse listings, save favorites, and explore marketplace activity through analytics and location pages.

`TODO:` Add 2-4 sentences here to describe your product goal, target users, and the main problem your team is solving.

## Tech Stack

- Ruby on Rails 8
- PostgreSQL
- Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- Sidekiq + Redis
- Cucumber, Minitest, RSpec gems
- SimpleCov gem for test coverage
- Mapbox for location display
- SendGrid for email delivery

## Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- Ruby `3.3.8`
- Bundler
- PostgreSQL
- Redis


### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RangerBZ/csci3100-project.git
cd csci3100-project
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill in the required values.

Example:

```env
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

Notes:

- `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` are required for PostgreSQL.
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is needed for the password reset email feature.
- `MAPBOX_TOKEN` is needed for the location map pages.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is used by the seeded admin account in development/test.

### 5. Prepare the Database

```bash
bin/rails db:prepare
bin/rails db:seed
```

The seeded data includes:

- sample users
- sample item listings
- CUHK-related locations
- a development/test admin account

### 6. Start Required Services

Start Redis in a separate terminal:

```bash
redis-server
```

Start Sidekiq in another terminal if you want background jobs and scheduled jobs:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### 7. Run the Application

```bash
bin/dev
```

If `bin/dev` is unavailable in your environment, you can also run:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Test Guide

### Run the automated tests

Run Rails tests:

```bash
bin/rails test
```

Run Cucumber features:

```bash
bundle exec cucumber
```

`TODO:` If your team also used RSpec examples in practice, add the exact command here.

- Some features depend on external tokens or services, especially SendGrid and Mapbox.
- Seed data is intended for development/test usage.
